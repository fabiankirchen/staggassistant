A Home Assistant integration for the **Fellow Stagg EKG Pro** kettle.
This integration bypasses the need for an official API by communicating directly with the kettle's internal **CLI wrapper** over HTTP.

## ✨ Features

* **Direct CLI Communication:** Sends commands directly to the device's internal interface (e.g., `ss S_Heat`, `settempr`).
* **Precision Control:** Supports 0.5°C steps for target temperature.
* **Configurable:** Adjust the update interval to your liking (default: 15s).
